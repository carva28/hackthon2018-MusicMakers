## Context:
#### Project developed under the scope of Sunset Hackathon 2018. 
We are MusicMakers a team who developed a music instrument like GarangeBand or Music Maker Jam, but we are different because we have a Bitalino RIOT which can send information to node.js and them shows the interaction of image in javascript and play the songs which are corresponding to the specific instrument.


## Technologies: 
### Hardware: 
* Bitalino

### Software: 
* Brackets
* 3Ds Max

### UI

We know the user is our goal so we design a UI that could allows the user interact perfectly with the Bitalino and can see some magic.
